## Website Build (saved thread)
- User requested to save current chat context as "Website Build" and resume later when mentioned.
- Environment: Ubuntu server `ubuntu-8gb-hel1-1`.
- Installed OpenClaw (npm global) in `/home/admin/.npm-global` and fixed PATH by adding `/home/admin/.npm-global/bin` to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile`.
- `openclaw --version` works (2026.2.2-3).
- `openclaw gateway status` shows local loopback gateway running at `127.0.0.1:18789`.
- `openclaw status` shows update available and Telegram channel enabled.
- Pairing issue: gateway dashboard shows "pairing required"; pairing is channel-based. CLI expects `openclaw pairing list telegram` (positional channel arg).
- No pending pairing requests yet; user sent `Pair` to Telegram bot at 12:21 UTC (waiting to run `openclaw pairing list telegram` then `openclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>`).
