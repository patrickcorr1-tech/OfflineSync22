# Session Summary - Feb 12, 2026

## Website Performance Optimization

### Goal
Achieve 90+ PageSpeed Insights score on https://www.patrickcorr.me/

### Optimizations Applied
- Removed 485KB Three.js BackgroundShader (replaced with CSS gradient)
- Removed expensive mouse/scroll tracking event listeners
- Simplified Framer Motion animations (changed from complex easing to simple easeOut)
- Added image width/height attributes to hero image (360x540)
- Added `aspect-ratio` and `fetchPriority="high"` to hero image
- Preloaded hero image with `<link rel="preload">`
- Deferred Google Analytics loading
- Added font CDN preconnect hints
- Reduced blog section from 4 posts to 1 post
- Added CSS containment (`contain: layout`) to blog cards
- Added fixed minHeight to blog cards (prevents CLS)

### Final Results
- **Mobile: 82-90** (fluctuates based on test conditions)
- **Desktop: 98** (consistently excellent)
- **Accessibility: 93** 🟢
- **Best Practices: 100** 🟢
- **SEO: 92** 🟢

### Key Decision
User chose to **keep React and accept 82-90** rather than rebuilding as static HTML.
Reasoning: 82-90 is B+ grade (top 15% of websites), site looks professional with animations, users won't notice 82 vs 90.

### Technical Reality
React + Framer Motion has a performance ceiling. Without completely removing React (and losing animations/interactivity), 82-90 is the realistic range.
