# Discovery Call Script — IT Consultancy

**Objective:** Understand client's situation, qualify the opportunity, establish credibility, and secure next steps (proposal meeting).

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Format:** Video call (Zoom/Teams) or phone

---

## Opening (2-3 minutes)

"Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today, [NAME]. I've reviewed your inquiry about [migration/security/infrastructure], and I'm looking forward to understanding more about your situation.

Before we dive in, would it be helpful if I briefly explained how I work, or would you prefer to start with your current challenges?"

*[Let them choose — shows you're consultative, not pushy]*

---

## Current State Assessment (10-12 minutes)

### Opening Question:
"To make sure I understand where you're at, could you walk me through your current IT setup?"

### Key Questions to Ask:

**Infrastructure:**
- "How many users and locations are we talking about?"
- "What's your current email system?"
- "Where do you store files currently — servers, cloud, or mixed?"
- "Are you using any collaboration tools like Teams, Slack, Zoom?"

**Pain Points:**
- "What's driving this conversation now? What prompted you to look at this?"
- "What are the biggest frustrations with your current setup?"
- "If you don't make any changes, what happens in 6-12 months?"

**Timeline:**
- "Do you have any hard deadlines I should be aware of?"
- "Is there an event driving this — lease ending, contract renewal, security incident?"

**Decision Process:**
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "Have you done this type of project before, or is this new territory?"
- "What's your budget range for this project?" *[Handle this diplomatically — see below]*

**Budget Question (if appropriate):**
"I work with businesses ranging from £3,000 to £50,000+ depending on scope. Without committing to a number, does that range sound like it might work, or should we discuss a different approach?"

---

## Their Goals (5-7 minutes)

"Let's talk about the ideal outcome. If we work together and this project is successful, what does that look like in 6 months?"

Listen for:
- Measurable outcomes ("reduce IT tickets by 50%")
- Business objectives ("enable remote work", "win that contract")
- User experience improvements ("people stop complaining about email")

**Follow-up:**
"Of those goals, which is the most important? What would you compromise on if needed?"

---

## Establishing Credibility (5 minutes)

"Based on what you've shared, this sounds similar to a project I completed for [similar company/industry]. They had [similar challenge], and we [solution]. The result was [outcome]."

**Then ask:**
"Does that sound like the type of approach that would work for you, or are there specific concerns you have?"

*[This positions you as experienced but opens door for them to voice concerns]*

---

## Handling Objections

### "Can you just give me a ballpark figure?"
"I understand you need budget visibility. Based on [X users/sites], projects typically range from £[X] to £[Y]. To give you a precise figure, I'd need to do a quick assessment of your current environment. I can provide a detailed proposal within 48 hours of a 30-minute technical review. Would that work?"

### "We need this done urgently"
"I can appreciate the urgency. Rushing migrations increases risk. Let me ask — what's the real deadline? If it's [specific event], we might be able to stage this — secure the critical piece first, then complete the rest properly. Can you tell me more about what's driving the timeline?"

### "We can probably do this ourselves"
"Absolutely, and if you have the internal expertise that's great. Can I ask — has your team done a migration like this before? [If yes] What happened last time? [If no] What would happen if this doesn't go smoothly? Sometimes it makes sense to have someone who's done this 50+ times guide the process, even if your team handles the day-to-day."

### "Your competitor quoted less"
"I can't speak to their approach, but I can tell you what I include: [specific value adds — pilot testing, 30-day support, admin training, documentation]. If budget is tight, I'm happy to discuss phasing the work or focusing on the highest-impact elements first. What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?"

---

## Next Steps (3-5 minutes)

### Qualify the Opportunity:
"Based on our conversation, this sounds like a good fit. Here's what I think makes sense as next steps:"

**Option A: They're Ready to Proceed**
"I'll prepare a detailed proposal breaking down the approach, timeline, and investment. I can have that to you by [day]. Once you've reviewed it, we can schedule a 30-minute call to walk through any questions. Does that work?"

**Option B: They Need More Information**
"Would it be helpful if I did a quick technical assessment of your current environment? It's non-intrusive — I just need 30 minutes with your IT person to understand what we're working with. From there I can give you a precise quote rather than a range. Does [day/time] work for that?"

**Option C: They're Not Ready**
"Totally understand — this is a significant decision. Would it be helpful if I sent you some resources? I have a free Microsoft 365 migration checklist that walks through the process. You can grab it at [link]. If questions come up as you work through it, just drop me an email. No pressure, no follow-up calls unless you reach out."

---

## Closing the Call

"Thanks for the conversation today, [NAME]. Just to confirm:"

- [Restate key points: X users, Y sites, timeline, next step]
- "I'll send you [proposal/checklist/assessment invite] by [timeframe]"
- "If anything changes or questions come up before then, just email me at patrickcorr4@gmail.com"
- "My mobile is [number] if anything urgent comes up"

"Looking forward to [next step]. Thanks again for your time."

**Subject:** Next steps: [Company] Microsoft 365 migration

Hi [NAME],

### Follow-up After No Response (5 days)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company] IT project

Hi [NAME],

I sent over the proposal last [day] and wanted to check in. Totally understand you're probably reviewing options or discussing internally.

Quick question: On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is this project now? Just want to make sure I'm not chasing if priorities have shifted.

If you have questions about the proposal or want to discuss phasing the work differently, I'm happy to jump on a quick call. No pressure either way.

Patrick

### Follow-up Final Attempt (14 days)

**Subject:** Should I close the file on [Company]?

Hi [NAME],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming priorities have shifted or you've gone in a different direction. No worries at all — happens all the time.

I'll close my file on this for now, but if circumstances change in the future, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to chat, even if just to answer questions.

Hope the project goes well whatever you decide.

Patrick

**[This often gets a response — either they're still interested or they'll tell you they've gone elsewhere, which is valuable information.]**
