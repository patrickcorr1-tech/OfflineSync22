**Generated:** Saturday, February 14th, 2026 — 12:00 AM (UTC)

## ⚠️ Configuration Issue

Himalaya CLI is not properly configured. The triage script could not connect to the email server due to authentication failure.

**Error:** Invalid credentials (Failure)

## How to Fix

1. Run `himalaya account configure` to set up your email account
2. Verify credentials are correct
3. Ensure IMAP access is enabled for your email provider

For Office 365 setup details, see:

## Scan Parameters
- **Stale threshold:** 1 day(s)
- **Folder scanned:** INBOX
- **Result:** Unable to scan - configuration required

## Next Steps

Once himalaya is configured, re-run:
```bash
python3 /home/admin/.openclaw/workspace/skills/email-triage/scripts/triage_emails.py --stale-days 1 --output /home/admin/.openclaw/workspace/email-reports/triage-$(date +%F).md
```
