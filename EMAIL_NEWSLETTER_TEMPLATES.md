## TEMPLATE 1: Welcome Email (New Subscriber)

**Subject:** Welcome! Here's your first IT tip

**Preview text:** The one thing most construction sites get wrong about backups

---

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for signing up for my monthly IT tips.

Once a month, you'll get practical advice on:
- Keeping your construction sites connected
- Protecting your business from cyber attacks
- Getting the most from Microsoft 365
- Technology that actually helps (not hinders) your projects

No jargon. No sales pitches. Just helpful stuff you can use.

**Here's your first tip:**

The #1 mistake I see with site backups?

People set them up, check the "success" email for a week, then never verify them again.

Six months later, when they actually need to restore a file... the backup has been failing silently for months.

**The fix:** Put a recurring calendar reminder to test your backup restoration monthly. Actually restore a file and open it. Takes 10 minutes, saves you from disaster.

---

**Quick question:** What's your biggest IT headache on construction sites right now?

Hit reply and let me know — I read every response and often turn them into future tips.

Talk soon,

Patrick

## TEMPLATE 2: Monthly Newsletter (Example: March)

**Subject:** 3 things to check before your next site launch

**Preview text:** Plus: Why your antivirus isn't enough anymore

---

Hi [First Name],

Spring project season is here. If you're starting new sites in the next few months, here are three things to check before your team arrives:

**1. Internet connectivity lead times**

Traditional leased lines still take 6-12 weeks to install. If you're counting on fibre for site launch, check the order status NOW.

Alternative: Starlink can be online in under an hour. I keep a kit in my car for exactly this situation.

**2. Microsoft license counts**

Did your team grow over winter? Running out of M365 licenses on day one of a project is embarrassing and expensive.

Check your active users vs licenses before the rush.

**3. Subcontractor access**

New subcontractors starting? Create their accounts early and test access to shared folders, project management tools, and site Wi-Fi.

Nothing says "unprofessional" like a subcontractor who can't access the drawings on their first day.

---

**This month's question:**

Has your business been targeted by phishing emails recently? (Be honest — most have, whether they realised or not)

→ Yes, and someone clicked
→ Yes, but we caught it
→ Not that I'm aware of
→ I have no idea

Hit reply with your answer — I'm curious about the real state of play out there.

**From the blog:**

I published three new guides this month:

1. [How to Choose an IT Support Company] — Red flags, fair pricing, and questions to ask
2. [Starlink for Construction Sites] — Complete setup guide with real costs
3. [5 Cybersecurity Mistakes] — Real stories of what happens when IT goes wrong

[Read them here →]

---

**Quick tip:**

Add a "report phishing" button to your Outlook ribbon. It trains Microsoft's filters AND alerts your IT team.

In Outlook: File → Options → Customize Ribbon → Add "Report Message"

Takes 2 minutes, significantly improves your email security.

That's it for this month. Questions? Just hit reply.

## TEMPLATE 3: Educational Deep Dive

**Subject:** The real cost of "cheap" IT support

**Preview text:** When £50/month becomes £15,000 in damages

---

Hi [First Name],

I got an email last week from a construction firm in Birmingham.

Subject line: "We need help urgently"

Their story:
- They'd been paying £50/month for IT support
- "Dave" (not his real name) handled everything remotely
- Dave was responsive, friendly, and cheap

Then their server failed.

Turns out Dave's "automated backup" hadn't worked in 8 months. The backup drive was full, and the error emails were going to an old address.

They lost:
- 6 months of project documentation
- 3 weeks of accounting records
- 2 weeks of productivity recovering what they could

Total cost: £15,000+ in recovery efforts, lost time, and incomplete records.

The £50/month "bargain" just became very expensive.

---

**Here's what proper IT support includes:**

✓ Backup monitoring (not just setup)
✓ Monthly testing of restoration
✓ Proactive maintenance
✓ Documented procedures
✓ Guaranteed response times
✓ Accountability when things go wrong

That costs more than £50/month. But it also prevents £15,000 disasters.

---

**The lesson:** Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.

When evaluating IT providers, ask:
- "How do you verify backups are working?"
- "What's your response time guarantee?"
- "Can I speak to two of your current clients?"

If they can't answer clearly, keep looking.

## TEMPLATE 4: Soft Promotion / Discovery Call Invite

**Subject:** Quick favour? (2-minute survey)

**Preview text:** Helping me understand what construction PMs actually need

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm planning my content for the next few months and could use your input.

If you have 2 minutes, reply with answers to any of these:

1. What's your biggest technology frustration on construction sites right now?

2. If you could wave a magic wand and fix one IT problem, what would it be?

3. What technology topic would you like to understand better?

4. How do you currently find IT support/help when you need it?

I'm asking because I want to write about what actually matters to you — not what I think matters.

As a thank you, everyone who responds gets early access to my upcoming guide: "The Construction Technology Stack" (covering all the tools modern sites need, and how they fit together).

Just hit reply with your thoughts. No essay required — bullet points are perfect.

Thanks in advance,

Patrick

P.S. If your answer to #1 is "I don't even know where to start," that's a valid answer too. Let me know and I'll send you my Site IT Checklist as a starting point.

## TEMPLATE 5: Re-engagement (For inactive subscribers)

**Subject:** Should I keep you on this list?

**Preview text:** One-click to stay, or I'll remove you (no hard feelings)

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you haven't opened my last few emails.

No worries — inboxes are crowded and priorities change.

But I want to make sure I'm not cluttering your inbox with stuff you don't need.

**Quick question:** Are you still interested in getting monthly IT tips for construction?

→ [YES, KEEP ME] — I'll keep sending helpful tips
→ [NO, REMOVE ME] — You'll be unsubscribed immediately

Either way is fine. I'd rather have a smaller list of engaged readers than a big list of people who delete my emails.

Thanks for your honesty.

Patrick
