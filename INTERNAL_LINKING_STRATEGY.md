## LINKING STRATEGY BY PAGE TYPE

### 1. HOMEPAGE (/) — Your Most Important Page

**Goal:** Guide visitors to services or blog content

**Should link to:**
- ✅ All 4 service pages (primary CTA)
- ✅ Blog listing (/blogs.html)
- ✅ FAQ (/faq.html)
- ✅ Contact (email link)
- ✅ 2-3 specific blog posts (latest/greatest)
- ❌ Individual city pages (too many, link from service pages instead)

**Current status:** Needs blog section added with 3 featured posts

**Action:** Add "Latest from the Blog" section with:
- 5 Cybersecurity Mistakes
- Starlink for Construction Sites
- How to Choose IT Support

---

### 2. SERVICE PAGES — Money Pages

**Goal:** Convert visitors into leads

**Each service page should link to:**
- ✅ Homepage (logo/breadcrumb)
- ✅ Other service pages ("Related Services" section)
- ✅ 2 relevant blog posts (deep content)
- ✅ FAQ page (address objections)
- ✅ Contact/email (primary CTA)
- ✅ 3-5 relevant location pages ("Serving [City]" sections)

**Example for /microsoft-365-migrations.html:**
```
Related Content:
→ The Complete Microsoft 365 Migration Checklist [blog post]
→ How to Choose an IT Support Company [blog post]
→ FAQ: Common M365 Migration Questions [FAQ anchor link]

Serving: London | Manchester | Birmingham | [more cities]

Related Services:
→ Multi-Site Network Setup
→ Cloud VOIP Solutions
```

---

### 3. BLOG POSTS — Content Pages

**Goal:** Build authority, capture emails, drive to services

**Every blog post should link to:**
- ✅ Homepage (logo/breadcrumb)
- ✅ Blog listing (/blogs.html)
- ✅ Related blog posts (2-3)
- ✅ Relevant service page (contextual CTA)
- ✅ Lead magnet/checklist (email capture)
- ✅ Contact/email (soft CTA in bio)

**Contextual linking rules:**
- Link naturally within the text (not just "click here")
- First link in article gets most SEO value
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "this post")
- 3-5 internal links per 1000 words

**Example from Starlink blog post:**
```
"If you're planning a new site, download my free [Construction Site IT Setup Checklist] for a complete pre-launch guide."

"For sites with permanent offices, consider [multi-site network setup] for better integration with your head office."

"Need help with your site connectivity? [Get in touch] for a free consultation."
```

---

### 4. LOCATION PAGES — SEO Landing Pages

**Goal:** Rank for "[service] in [city]" searches

**Each location page should link to:**
- ✅ Homepage
- ✅ All 4 service pages (with city-specific copy)
- ✅ Blog listing ("Latest tips for [City] businesses")
- ✅ Contact/email ("Serving [City] and surrounding areas")
- ✅ 2-3 other nearby location pages ("Also serving...")
- ❌ Distant cities (keep it local)

**Example for /london.html:**
```
Services for London Construction Firms:
→ Microsoft 365 Migrations in London
→ Multi-Site IT for London Projects
→ Cloud VOIP for London Offices
→ AI CCTV for London Sites

Also serving: Croydon | Watford | Slough | Reading

**Should link to:**
- ✅ Homepage
- ✅ All service pages ("Learn more about...")
- ✅ Blog posts ("Read our detailed guide...")
- ✅ Contact ("Still have questions?")
- ✅ Specific location pages ("Services available in...")

---

## ANCHOR TEXT STRATEGY

### Good Anchor Text (descriptive):
- "Microsoft 365 migration checklist"
- "IT support for construction companies"
- "Starlink satellite internet setup guide"
- "cybersecurity mistakes to avoid"

### Bad Anchor Text (not descriptive):

- "read more"
- "this article"
- "here"

### Branded vs Exact Match:
- Use branded for homepage: "Patrick Corr"
- Use exact match for service pages: "Microsoft 365 migration services"
