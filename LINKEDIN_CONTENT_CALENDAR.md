## WEEK 1: Foundation & Authority

### Day 1 (Monday) - Intro Post
**Format:** Text post with line breaks
**Content:**
```
I help construction companies stop losing money to bad IT decisions.

After 15 years managing IT for £10m+ projects, I've seen the same mistakes repeatedly:

→ Paying for internet that doesn't work on remote sites
→ Security setups that fail when you actually need them  
→ Migration projects that drag on for months

The pattern? Most IT providers don't understand construction.

They've never had to:
• Get connectivity to a greenfield site with no infrastructure
• Set up 200 user accounts overnight for a new project team
• Keep critical systems running when a deadline is looming

That's why I focus exclusively on construction and professional services.

If you're wrestling with IT problems that are slowing your projects down, let's talk.

### Day 3 (Wednesday) - Quick Tip
**Format:** Short text post
**Content:**
```
Quick IT tip for construction project managers:

Before you start a new site, check mobile signal strength on the plot of land.

Don't rely on the developer's promises. Walk the site with your phone. Test:

→ Where will the site office go? Check signal there.
→ Where will materials be stored? You'll need connectivity.
→ Where will the crane go? Sometimes that's your best mounting point.

I keep a Starlink kit in my car for exactly this reason. When 4G doesn't work, we can have internet in under an hour.

Saved my last client 3 weeks of waiting for a leased line.

### Day 4 (Thursday) - Behind the Scenes
**Format:** Photo + caption (if you have site photos)
**Content:**
```
Tuesday morning: Yorkshire, -2°C, middle of a field that will be a distribution centre in 18 months.

Today's challenge: Get internet connectivity to a site with zero infrastructure.

The solution: Starlink dish on a temporary mast, battery backup, weatherproof enclosure.

By lunchtime: 150 Mbps, 20ms latency, 40 users online.

This is why I love the work. Problems that seem impossible become simple with the right approach.

[Photo of dish on site]

```

**Alt without photo:**
```
The best part of my job?

Getting that call: "We're starting a new site tomorrow and we have no internet."

Then delivering a solution before lunch.

Remote construction sites are connectivity puzzles. Each one is different:

• Tree cover blocking satellite
• No power to the location we need
• Heavy machinery creating interference
• Weather exposure concerns

Every site teaches me something new.

What's the most challenging site condition you've worked with?

### Day 5 (Friday) - Industry Commentary
**Format:** Text post sharing an article
**Content:**
```
This headline caught my attention today:

"Ransomware attacks on construction firms up 300% in 2025"

It's not surprising. Construction companies are perfect targets:

→ Tight project deadlines (pay the ransom or miss the deadline)
→ Valuable intellectual property (drawings, designs, bids)
→ Often underinvested in cybersecurity
→ Distributed workforce (harder to monitor)

The firms I work with have three things in common:
1. Working backups tested monthly
2. Multi-factor authentication on everything
3. A plan that doesn't involve paying criminals

If you don't have all three, you're gambling.

Link to my cybersecurity checklist in comments.

## WEEK 2: Value & Education

### Day 8 (Monday) - Myth Busting
**Format:** Text with emoji bullets
**Content:**
```
❌ MYTH: "We can't use cloud services on construction sites because the internet is unreliable"

✅ FACT: Modern construction sites can have better connectivity than most offices

Here's what's possible today:

→ Starlink: 50-200 Mbps anywhere with sky visibility
→ 5G: 100+ Mbps in most urban areas  
→ Hybrid setups: Combine multiple connections for redundancy
→ Edge caching: Critical files stored locally, sync to cloud

I recently deployed a multi-site setup with:
• Primary: Starlink (150 Mbps)
• Backup: 5G router (80 Mbps)
• Local cache: Critical drawings available offline
• Result: Zero downtime in 6 months

The technology exists. The limitation is usually imagination (or outdated IT advice).

### Day 9 (Tuesday) - Case Study Snippet
**Format:** Story format
**Content:**
```
"Our email migration will take 3 weeks and we'll have downtime every evening"

That's what their previous IT company said.

We did it in 4 days with zero downtime.

Here's how:

📅 Day 1: Preparation
• Synced all mailboxes in background (users kept working)
• Created new profiles ready to switch
• Briefed department heads on process

📅 Day 2: Pilot group (20 users)
• Switched over at 6 PM
• Monitored for issues overnight
• Made adjustments based on feedback

📅 Day 3-4: Remaining 180 users
• Department-by-department rollout
• 15-minute switchover per person
• Support on-site for first day

Result: 
✅ 4 days vs 3 weeks
✅ Zero business disruption
✅ No evening downtime
✅ Happy users

The difference? Experience with large migrations and proper planning.

### Day 11 (Thursday) - Tool/App Recommendation
**Format:** List format
**Content:**
```
3 tools I install on every construction site:

1️⃣ Microsoft Teams (with proper channels set up)
   → Site team, office team, subcontractors, safety
   → File sharing that actually works
   → Video calls from the site cabin

2️⃣ Procore or similar (project management)
   → Central drawings everyone can access
   → RFIs and submittals in one place
   → Progress photos auto-organised

3️⃣ Verkada or similar (cloud CCTV)
   → View from anywhere (including client demos)
   → Automatic alerts for safety issues
   → No on-site recorder to maintain

The key isn't the tools — it's the setup.

Default configurations rarely work for construction. You need:
• Proper permissions (subcontractors see only their areas)
• Mobile-optimised workflows
• Offline access for areas with poor signal
• Integration between systems

Want help setting these up properly? Message me.

### Day 12 (Friday) - Personal Story/Origin
**Format:** Storytelling post
**Content:**
```
15 years ago, I watched a construction project lose £50,000 because of an IT failure.

A server crash. No working backup. Three days to restore.

The project manager told me: "We spent more time worrying about computers than building."

That stuck with me.

I went away and learned:
• How to design systems that don't fail
• How to recover quickly when they do
• How to explain technology without jargon
• How to make IT support the project, not slow it down

Now I work with construction firms across the UK and Europe.

The projects are bigger. The stakes are higher. But the principle is the same:

Technology should make construction easier, not harder.

If your IT is causing more problems than it solves, something's wrong.

Let's fix it.

## WEEK 3: Social Proof & Results

### Day 15 (Monday) - Testimonial/Result
**Format:** Result-focused post
**Content:**
```
"40% faster incident response time"

That was the result of our CCTV upgrade for a £10m construction fit-out.

Not because we bought expensive cameras.

Because we bought the RIGHT cameras and set them up properly.

The old system:
❌ Recorded everything but finding footage took hours
❌ Constant false alarms (birds, shadows, weather)
❌ Cameras went offline and nobody noticed

The new system:
✅ AI-powered search: "Find me hard hats without people" → 10 seconds
✅ Smart alerts: Only notify for actual issues
✅ Health monitoring: Offline cameras detected in minutes

The site manager's words: "I actually use the CCTV now instead of ignoring it."

Technology should solve problems, not create them.

### Day 16 (Tuesday) - Comparison/Contrast
**Format:** Two-column comparison
**Content:**
```
IT Support: £50/user/month vs £80/user/month

The cheaper option includes:
✓ Remote support during business hours
✓ Basic antivirus
✓ Monthly reports

The more expensive option includes:
✓ Everything above PLUS
✓ 24/7 emergency response
✓ Quarterly business reviews
✓ Strategic IT planning
✓ Proactive monitoring (problems fixed before you notice)
✓ Guaranteed response times in writing

For a 20-person company:
• Option 1: £1,000/month
• Option 2: £1,600/month

Difference: £7,200/year

Cost of one major IT failure: £15,000-£50,000+

"Expensive" IT support is usually cheaper than cheap IT support.

### Day 17 (Wednesday) - Trending Topic
**Format:** Commentary on news
**Content:**
```
Microsoft just announced Copilot features for construction workflows.

AI that can:
→ Read drawings and highlight potential conflicts
→ Summarise long email chains about variations
→ Predict project delays based on current data
→ Generate safety reports from site observations

This is happening now. Not in 5 years.

The construction firms that embrace this will have a massive advantage.

The ones that don't will wonder why their competitors deliver faster and cheaper.

I'm already testing these tools with select clients.

If you want to be in the first wave (not playing catch-up later), let's talk.

### Day 18 (Thursday) - Quick Win/Tip
**Format:** Numbered tip
**Content:**
```
⚡ 2-minute security check:

Go to haveibeenpwned.com and enter your business email address.

If it shows breaches, attackers have your password from those breaches.

If you use that same password anywhere else, change it NOW.

Then enable two-factor authentication on:
1. Your email
2. Your cloud storage
3. Your banking
4. Any system with financial or client data

Total time: 10 minutes
Protection level: Massively increased

I see too many construction firms skip the basics then wonder how attackers got in.

Don't be that firm.

### Day 19 (Friday) - Weekend Thought
**Format:** Reflection post
**Content:**
```
The best project managers I work with have one thing in common:

They ask about IT early.

Not when the problem is urgent.
Not when the deadline is looming.
Not when something breaks.

At the START of planning.

"We're looking at this site. What do we need for connectivity?"
"We're bidding this project. What's the IT infrastructure budget?"
"We're expanding. How do we scale our systems?"

IT should be part of project planning, not an afterthought.

The earlier I'm involved, the more money I can save you.

If you've got projects on the horizon, let's talk before you need me urgently.

### Day 23 (Tuesday) - Objection Handling
**Format:** Addressing common concern
**Content:**
```
"We had a bad experience with our last IT company"

I hear this at least once a week.

Bad experiences usually fall into three categories:

1️⃣ The "ghost" provider
   → Hard to reach, slow to respond, then vanishes when you really need them

2️⃣ The jargon speaker
   → Can't explain anything simply, makes you feel stupid for asking questions

3️⃣ The surprise biller
   → "That'll be £3,000 for this thing we never mentioned"

Here's how I'm different:

✓ I answer my phone (or call back within an hour)
✓ I explain things in plain English (construction analogies help)
✓ Fixed monthly pricing with no surprises

Don't let a bad past experience stop you getting the support you need.

### Day 24 (Wednesday) - Process Explanation
**Format:** Step-by-step
**Content:**
```
What happens when you book a discovery call with me:

📅 STEP 1: Book a 30-minute slot
   → Online calendar, pick a time that works
   → No back-and-forth emails

📞 STEP 2: We talk
   → I ask about your business, challenges, goals
   → You ask me anything
   → Zero sales pressure — just a conversation

📋 STEP 3: I send a summary
   → What I heard
   → Suggested next steps (if any)
   → Honest assessment of whether I can help

🤝 STEP 4: You decide
   → If it makes sense to work together, great
   → If not, you've lost 30 minutes and gained clarity

I don't do "discovery calls" that are really sales pitches.

I do actual conversations where we both figure out if there's a fit.

### Day 25 (Thursday) - Urgency/Scarcity
**Format:** Soft urgency
**Content:**
```
I'm taking on 2 new clients in March.

Not 20. Not 10. Two.

Why? Because I do the work personally.

I don't have a team of junior engineers learning on your project.

I show up. I fix things. I make sure it works.

That means limited capacity.

If you've been thinking about getting your IT sorted, now's the time to book a call.

First come, first served.
