## Template 1: Cybersecurity Query

**When to use:** Journalist asking about cybersecurity, hacking, business security

```
Subject: RE: [Query Title] - Source: Patrick Corr, IT Security Leader

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm Patrick Corr, Head of IT & Security Leader with 10+ years experience managing cybersecurity for multi-site businesses. I'd be happy to contribute to your article.

[Answer their specific question in 2-3 punchy sentences]

For example, if asked "What's the biggest cybersecurity mistake small businesses make?"

"The biggest mistake is treating cybersecurity as an IT issue rather than a business risk. I've seen companies spend thousands on firewalls while staff use 'Password123' because they never implemented basic security training. The best technology fails if your people don't understand the threats."

BACKGROUND:
- Lead IT for 5 businesses, 6 sites, 250+ users
- Implement Cyber Essentials and ISO 27001 frameworks
- Specialise in Microsoft 365 security hardening
- Based: UK, work internationally

Happy to expand on any points or provide additional quotes.

## Template 2: Technology/Cloud Migration Query

**When to use:** Questions about cloud migration, digital transformation, Microsoft 365

```
Subject: RE: [Query Title] - Cloud Migration Expert

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'd love to contribute to your piece on [topic]. I'm Patrick Corr, an IT leader who's managed 50+ Microsoft 365 migrations for businesses across the UK and Europe.

[Your answer to their question]

Example - if asked "What should businesses know before migrating to the cloud?"

"The cloud isn't just 'your stuff, but online'—it's a chance to redesign how you work. The businesses that struggle treat migration like a data move; the ones that succeed use it as an opportunity to clean up years of digital clutter and modernise their security. Always run a pilot with your most challenging users first—they'll surface issues that tech testing won't catch."

QUICK BIO:
- 10+ years IT leadership
- Microsoft 365 migration specialist
- Multi-site network design
- Cybersecurity compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Available for follow-up if helpful

Best,

## Template 3: Business/Remote Work Query

**When to use:** Remote work, hybrid teams, business technology

```
Subject: RE: [Query Title] - Multi-Site IT Expert Available

Hi [Journalist Name],

Count me in as a source for your article on [topic]. I'm Patrick Corr, Head of IT for a group of companies with 6 sites across the UK—so remote/hybrid work infrastructure is my daily reality.

[Your answer]

Example - if asked "What technology do hybrid teams actually need?"

"Forget the fancy stuff—hybrid teams need reliability above all. The businesses I see struggling are those with patchwork solutions: Zoom for calls, Dropbox for files, WhatsApp for chat. The ones that thrive standardise on integrated platforms like Microsoft 365, where everything talks to everything else. One login, one place for files, one system for calls and chat. It's less about having the newest tools and more about having tools that don't fight each other."

## Example Successful Response

**Query:** "Looking for IT experts on the biggest tech mistakes small businesses make"

**Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Biggest tech mistake: Buying solutions before understanding problems.

I see businesses drop £10k on CRM systems when a £20/month tool would do. Or invest in AI security while staff still use 'Password123'.

The pattern? They read about 'what successful companies do' instead of asking 'what specific problem are we solving?'
