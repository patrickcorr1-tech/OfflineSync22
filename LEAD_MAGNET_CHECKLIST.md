### Page 1: Introduction

**Welcome**

Starting a new construction site? This checklist will save you hours of headaches and thousands in unexpected costs.

I've used this exact process on £10m+ projects across the UK and Europe. It covers everything from internet connectivity to user accounts to security — in the order you actually need them.

**How to use this checklist:**
- Print it out and tick off items as you complete them
- Share with your site team and IT provider
- Refer back for each new project

**Need help?** If you get stuck on any item, email me at patrickcorr4@gmail.com — I'm happy to point you in the right direction.

**Connectivity Planning**

□ Survey site for mobile signal strength (all major networks)
□ Check fibre availability and lead times (usually 6-12 weeks)
□ Identify alternative connectivity options:
   □ Starlink (fastest setup, works anywhere)
   □ 4G/5G business broadband
   □ Wireless point-to-point from nearby building
□ Order primary connectivity (minimum 50 Mbps for 20+ users)
□ Order backup connectivity (different technology from primary)
□ Arrange site visit from connectivity provider to check line of sight/obstacles

**Infrastructure**

□ Design site network layout (office locations, Wi-Fi coverage areas)
□ Plan cable routes (underground vs overhead, protection from vehicles)
□ Order network equipment:
   □ Router/firewall (business-grade, not consumer)
   □ Switches (with PoE for CCTV/phones if needed)
   □ Wi-Fi access points (weatherproof for outdoor coverage)
   □ Patch cables, trunking, cable management
□ Arrange power for network equipment (UPS backup recommended)
□ Plan equipment locations (secure, ventilated, accessible)

**User Accounts Planning**

□ Count total users (site team, office staff, subcontractors)
□ List required systems (email, file sharing, project management, etc.)
□ Prepare user onboarding spreadsheet (name, role, required access)
□ Set up email domain if new site (or confirm subdomain)
□ Configure Microsoft 365/Google Workspace licenses
