Patrick Corr Launches Comprehensive IT Consultancy Services
Specialising in Microsoft 365 Migrations, Cybersecurity Compliance, and Multi-Site Infrastructure

[City, Date] — Patrick Corr, an experienced Head of IT and Security Leader, today announced the launch of his comprehensive IT consultancy services, helping businesses across the UK, Europe, and USA modernise their technology infrastructure with secure, scalable solutions.

With over a decade of experience managing IT operations for multi-site organisations, Patrick brings a unique blend of strategic leadership and hands-on technical expertise to businesses looking to navigate complex digital transformations.

"Technology should enable your business, not hinder it," says Patrick Corr. "I've seen too many companies struggle with outdated systems or botched migrations that cost them time and money. My approach focuses on clean execution, minimal disruption, and measurable outcomes."

Core Services Include:

• Microsoft 365 Migrations — Complete email, file, and identity migrations with zero-downtime guarantees
• Multi-Site Network Design — WAN/VPN infrastructure connecting distributed teams securely
• Cybersecurity Compliance — Implementation of Cyber Essentials, ISO 27001, and GDPR frameworks
• Cloud VOIP Systems — Modern telephony integrated with Microsoft Teams
• AI CCTV & Security — Intelligent video analytics with automated threat detection

Patrick has successfully delivered 50+ Microsoft 365 migrations for businesses ranging from 20 to 500 users, maintaining 100% data integrity and minimal business disruption. His client base spans construction, professional services, manufacturing, and technology sectors.

"What sets Patrick apart is his calm, pragmatic approach," says an Operations Director at a UK construction firm. "In high-pressure environments, you want someone who delivers secure, scalable solutions without the drama. That's exactly what we got."

Based in the UK with regular on-site presence across England, Scotland, Wales, and Europe, Patrick offers both remote-first delivery and strategic on-site visits. His services are particularly valuable for organisations with 50-500 users or multiple locations requiring consistent IT support and security posture.

To support businesses considering technology upgrades, Patrick has published a comprehensive Microsoft 365 Migration Guide, available free on his website. The guide provides a 10-step checklist based on real-world project experience.

"Whether you're migrating to the cloud for the first time or hardening your security posture, the key is planning," Patrick explains. "My free guide helps business owners understand what to expect and avoid common pitfalls."
